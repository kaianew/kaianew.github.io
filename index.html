					<h1>About</h1>
				</header>
				<p>I'm Kaia Newman, a first year Ph.D. student in Software Engineering in the <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/">Software & Societal Systems</a> department at Carnegie Mellon University. 
					I'm advised by <a href="https://andrewbegel.com/">Andrew Begel</a>, and thus am a part of the <a href="https://cmu-variability.github.io/">VariAbility</a> lab.</p>

				<p>My research is on human-centered aspects of software engineering, such as program comprehension, developer productivity and wellbeing, communication in software teams, 
					and neurodivergent developer accessibility.
					I am also interested in research aiding other software engineering researchers with their research
					(e.g., with tools that ensure rigor of empirical methods).
				</p>
				
				<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. In my free time, I enjoy written communication, watching the reality TV show <i>Survivor</i>,
				doing crosswords, running, playing Magic: The Gathering, and easy reading.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>April 4th, 2024: I received the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship! Thank you to everyone who supported me along the way. 
						You can view my statements here: (<a href="Personal_Statement.pdf">Personal Statement</a>, <a href="Research_Proposal.pdf">Research Proposal</a>).</li>
					<li>March 5th, 2024: I gave a guest lecture and discussion on qualitative methods and my experiences in academia at Bowdoin College. :D </li>
					<li>February 27th, 2024: Our paper, "Causal Relationships and Programming Outcomes: A Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Experiment," received
						an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award! This paper was an involved, risky, collaborative project, so it is wonderful to see it recognized. <img src="cat.webp">
